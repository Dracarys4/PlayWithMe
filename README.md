# PlayWithMe
Place for my Discord Bot PlayWithMe!

The Bot is meant to allow a user to use a command in Discord to change or return values within a Google Spreadsheet. This was made for my group of friends and our personal use for games that involve extensive amounts of information dumps.


Has two commands: !rtnVal and !chngVal. Both must be followed by the name of the Sheet (the "tabs" at the bottom of every Spreadsheet), an exclaimation point, and either the column-row identification for a cell or, if multiple cells, then the column-row identification is followed by a colon and another column-row identification.
